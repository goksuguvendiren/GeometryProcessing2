Get different combinations of tables and chairs. Note that, 2 files here are not necessarily properly scaled. First adjust their scales. Then adjust their positions such that
i) chair is not in the bounding box of the table, e.g., someone finished the dinner and left without pushing the seat-part of the chair under the table
ii) chair seat-part is partially under the table, e.g., an invisible person currently eating/studying
iii) chair seat-part is completely under the table
iv) chair is to the left/right of the table

Two meshes should never intersect after you do the adjustments.

Please write the adjusted files, i.e., your actual input, to *Xadj.obj where X is the id of the file your adjusting.
